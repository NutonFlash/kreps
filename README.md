**InfluxDB Benchmark**: A client-server application designed to visualize the results of InfluxDB benchmark tests. It evaluates the writing speed and memory usage with varying numbers of workers and batch sizes, providing insights through a series of React components.

### IoTDB Related

[![IoTDB Redis Connector](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-IoTDB%20Redis%20Connector-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/NutonFlash/iotdb-redis-connector)

**IoTDB Redis Connector**: This repository contains tools for integrating Redis with IoTDB. It includes a project for generating real-time data and writing it to Redis, and another project for reading data from Redis and writing it to IoTDB using Spark.

[![IoTDB Hadoop Connector](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-IoTDB%20Hadoop%20Connector-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/NutonFlash/iotdb-hadoop-connector)

**IoTDB Hadoop Connector**: Facilitates data migration between IoTDB and HDFS. This project includes scripts to read data from IoTDB and write it to HDFS, as well as the reverse process of reading data from HDFS and writing it back to IoTDB.

[![IoTDB Client Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-IoTDB%20Client%20Server-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/NutonFlash/iotdb-client-server)

**IoTDB Client Server**: A comprehensive solution that includes scripts for reading/writing data to IoTDB, as well as WebSocket, Spring, and RPC servers to handle client requests, manage IoTDB interactions, and facilitate data transfer.
